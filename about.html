            <h2>My Experience:</h2>
            <h3>As as strong dedicated worker, I have a lot of experience in customer service, and am a hard worker in any task that I am given. I am currently a senior in high school enrolled at Crimson Cliffs, and I previously attended Wilton High school located in Wilton, Connecticut. I have experience in customer service as I worked at a local grocery store for 2 years. I trained for and have received my lifeguard and CPR certification, but as of right now, I have not had experience as a lifeguard. I have also worked with kids while babysitting/nannying for periods of time when needed. I am currently working at a retail, store in the Red Cliffs mall, called One Loved Babe! </h3>
